title: Luminous Grotto
description: You emerge into a breathtaking grotto where massive crystal spires rise
  from the floor like frozen geysers, their surfaces alive with an inner blue light.
  The crystals range from the size of your fist to towering pillars twice your height,
  creating a maze of shimmering pathways. The air here is thick with floating particles
  that sparkle like diamond dust, and the soft chiming of crystal against crystal
  creates an ethereal melody. A shallow stream of crystal-clear water winds between
  the formations, disappearing into a passage to the south.

title: Underground River
description: A swift underground river cuts through this cavern, its waters rushing
  over beds of luminescent crystals that make the entire waterway glow like liquid
  starlight. The river is perhaps twenty feet wide, too fast and deep to wade,
  but a natural bridge of fused crystal formations arches over its center. The
  roar of the water echoes off the crystal walls, creating a constant white noise
  that drowns out subtler sounds. Mist rises from where the water tumbles over
  a series of small falls, catching the light and creating ephemeral rainbows.

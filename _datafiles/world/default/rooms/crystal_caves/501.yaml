title: Twilight Passage
description: The passage descends at a gentle slope, the walls growing increasingly
  crystalline as you venture deeper. Pale amethyst and rose quartz formations jut
  from the walls like frozen flowers, their surfaces catching and refracting the
  bioluminescent glow that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere. The ceiling
  arches high overhead, lost in shadow, while the floor has been worn smooth by
  centuries of underground streams. Two passages branch off ahead, one emanating
  a stronger blue glow, the other a softer green luminescence.

idlemessages:
- The crystals chime softly as air currents pass through them.
- A luminescent moth flutters past, leaving a trail of glowing dust.
- You feel a subtle vibration through the floor, as if the caves themselves are humming.

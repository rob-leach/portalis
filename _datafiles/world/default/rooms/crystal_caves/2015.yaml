title: Seer's Alcove
description: This secluded alcove is dominated by a massive crystal formation that
  has grown into a shape remarkably like a throne. The crystal is perfectly clear,
  its interior filled with swirling motes of light that move with apparent purpose.
  Smaller crystals cluster around the base like attendants, each one glowing with
  soft pastel hues. The alcove itself seems designed for contemplation, its walls
  carved with ancient symbols that glow faintly when observed directly. A sense
  of profound peace and clarity pervades this space, and you feel your thoughts
  becoming sharper, more focused.

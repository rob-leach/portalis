title: Matriarch's Throne
description: You have entered the throne room of the Crystal Matriarch, a chamber
  of staggering beauty and terrible power. Massive crystal pillars support a ceiling
  lost in golden luminescence, each one humming with contained energy. The walls
  are honeycombed with alcoves containing crystal eggs that pulse with inner light.
  At the chamber's heart rises a throne of pure crystal, grown rather than carved,
  its facets reflecting and amplifying the light until the very air seems to glow.
  This is the heart of the caves, the source of all the crystalline life that
  fills these depths. Here dwells the Matriarch, ancient beyond reckoning, who
  has watched over these caves since before memory.

    a nascent crystal entity, waiting to hatch in decades or centuries. Disturbing
    them would surely anger their mother.
  throne: The throne is grown from a single perfect crystal, its surface alive with
    reflected light. It radiates warmth and power, the accumulated energy of ages.
  pillars: The crystal pillars hum with contained energy, supporting not just the
    ceiling but the magical matrix that sustains all life in these caves.

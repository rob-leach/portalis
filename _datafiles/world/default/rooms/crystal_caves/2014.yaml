title: Geode Chamber
description: This chamber appears to be the inside of an enormous geode, its walls
  completely covered in crystal formations that point inward like the teeth of some
  great beast. The crystals here are predominantly deep purple and violet, shot
  through with veins of gold that catch the light. The floor is relatively smooth,
  worn by centuries of crystal dust accumulation, and small geodes are scattered
  about, some split open to reveal sparkling interiors. The air smells of ozone
  and ancient stone, and there's a subtle hum that seems to emanate from the very
  walls themselves.

title: Matriarch's Antechamber
description: The passage opens into a vast antechamber that takes your breath away.
  The walls are covered in crystals of impossible size and complexity, formations
  that must have taken millennia to grow. They spiral and twist in organic patterns,
  creating natural archways and alcoves. The light here is different, warmer and
  more golden, emanating from deep within the crystals themselves. The floor is
  strewn with smaller crystal shards, some bearing what look like claw marks.
  Ahead, a massive archway formed of interlocking crystals frames a passage into
  an even greater chamber, where something immense and luminous moves.

- The crystals ahead pulse with a rhythm like breathing.
- A deep vibration passes through the floor, and the shards rattle.
- Something massive moves beyond the archway, casting shifting shadows.
- The golden light intensifies briefly, as if in warning.
- Claw marks on a nearby crystal seem fresh, the stone still warm.

title: Spore Hollow
description: This rounded chamber is dominated by massive shelf fungi that grow in
  spiraling tiers up the walls, creating natural platforms and ledges. The fungi
  glow with an intense violet light, and the air is thick with drifting spores
  that catch the light and sparkle like amethyst dust. The floor is soft with
  accumulated organic matter, cushioning each footstep. Strange clicking sounds
  echo from somewhere in the darkness above, and occasionally a cluster of spores
  will suddenly glow brighter before releasing in a puff of luminescent cloud.

title: Glowcap Grove
description: A forest of luminescent mushrooms fills this expansive cavern, their
  caps glowing in shades of teal and cyan that cast the entire space in an aquatic
  light. The largest specimens tower overhead, their stems thick as tree trunks
  and their caps broad enough to provide shelter. Smaller mushrooms carpet the
  ground in clusters, creating a soft phosphorescent carpet that squishes gently
  underfoot. The air smells of petrichor and something sweeter, almost honeyed,
  and the temperature here is pleasantly warm. Paths wind between the fungal giants,
  marked by trails of luminescent slime left by unknown creatures.

- A massive mushroom cap slowly rotates, following some unseen light source.
- Bioluminescent trails on the ground pulse in sequence, like veins.
- A cluster of small mushrooms suddenly brighten, then dim in unison.
- Something moves through the grove in the distance, too far to see clearly.

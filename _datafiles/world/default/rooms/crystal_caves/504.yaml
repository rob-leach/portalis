title: Crystal Stream
description: A underground stream flows through this cavern, its waters so clear that
  the crystalline bed beneath is perfectly visible. The stream has carved smooth
  channels through formations of blue and white crystal, creating natural bridges
  and stepping stones. Bioluminescent algae coat the rocks at the water's edge,
  pulsing with a gentle green glow that reflects off the water's surface. The sound
  of flowing water echoes soothingly off the crystal walls, and the air here is
  cool and fresh, a relief from the humid passages above.

- The bioluminescent algae pulse brighter for a moment, then dim.
- Ripples spread across the stream's surface from some unseen disturbance.

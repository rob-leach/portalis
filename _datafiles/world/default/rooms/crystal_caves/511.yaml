title: Bioluminescent Beach
description: The underground river slows here, spreading into a wide, shallow lake
  that laps against a beach of fine crystal sand. The sand itself glows faintly,
  a mixture of crushed crystal and bioluminescent organisms that sparkle like
  stars beneath your feet. The lake is dotted with small islands of fused crystal,
  each one hosting clusters of glowing fungi or delicate crystal formations. The
  far shore is lost in a haze of luminescent mist, and the gentle lapping of
  waves creates a peaceful rhythm. Small creatures leave trails of light as they
  swim just beneath the surface.

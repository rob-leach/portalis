title: Crystal Heart
description: You have found the heart of the Crystal Caves, a vast central chamber
  where all paths converge. A massive geode dominates the center, split open to
  reveal an interior of breathtaking amethyst crystals that pulse with inner light.
  The walls are encrusted with formations in every color imaginable, creating a
  kaleidoscope of luminescence that shifts and changes as you move. Multiple passages
  branch off in different directions, each one glowing with a distinct hue. The air
  here feels charged with energy, and the crystals seem to respond to your presence,
  brightening when you approach and dimming when you step away.

- The air crackles with energy, raising the hairs on your arms.
- You feel an ancient awareness briefly focus on you, then look away.
- The crystals hum in perfect harmony, a sound felt more than heard.

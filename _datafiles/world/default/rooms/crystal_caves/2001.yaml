title: Cave Entrance
description: A yawning opening in the frost-covered hillside reveals a passage descending
  into darkness. The walls transition from rough stone to smooth, crystalline surfaces
  that catch and scatter the fading daylight from above. A constant draft of warm,
  humid air rises from below, carrying the faint scent of minerals and something
  almost... alive. Pale blue crystals embedded in the walls emit a soft glow, just
  bright enough to see by, beckoning adventurers into the depths below.

title: Reflecting Pool
description: The crystal stream empties here into a perfectly still pool that acts
  as a flawless mirror, reflecting the crystal formations above with such clarity
  that it's difficult to tell where reality ends and reflection begins. Massive
  stalactites of pale blue crystal hang from the ceiling, their tips nearly touching
  the water's surface, while their reflections seem to rise from impossible depths
  below. The pool is ringed by smooth crystal formations that glow with an inner
  light, casting rippling reflections across the cavern walls. An otherworldly
  peace permeates this place.

- The pool's surface ripples without any apparent cause.
- For a moment, your reflection seems to move independently of you.
- A crystal stalactite chimes softly as a drop of water falls from its tip.
- The reflected crystals seem to glow brighter than the real ones.

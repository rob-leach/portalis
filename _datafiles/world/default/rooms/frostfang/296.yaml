title: The Southern Road
description: The road continues toward where Frost Lake once beckoned, but your path
  is now blocked by an imposing construction barrier. Massive iron barricades painted
  in garish yellow and black stripes span the path to the southeast, festooned with
  flickering arcane warning lights that pulse in hypnotic patterns. Through gaps in
  the barricade, you can glimpse nothing but a shimmering haze where the lake should
  be, as if reality itself is being rewritten.

  barrier: The construction barriers are made of heavy iron plates, riveted together
    and anchored deep into the frozen ground. Runes of warding have been hastily
    painted along their edges, still glowing faintly with protective magic.
  barricade: :barrier
  signs: Multiple warning signs have been bolted to the barriers, warning of
    DIMENSIONAL INSTABILITY AHEAD and that TRESPASSERS WILL BE FORCIBLY REMOVED.
  lights: The warning lights pulse with an eerie arcane glow, powered by small
    runestones embedded in the barrier posts. They cast shifting orange and red
    shadows across the road.

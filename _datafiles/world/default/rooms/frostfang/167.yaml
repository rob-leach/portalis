title: Outside The West Gate
description: Outside of the frost-covered gates to the west of Frostfang, the biting
  chill of the Whispering Wastes engulfs you. Towering snowdrifts and icy winds dominate
  the bleak landscape, where visibility is a constant struggle against the swirling
  snow. The path ahead is a treacherous mix of ice and fragmented stone, barely discernible
  under the thick blanket of white. The howling wind carries faint, eerie whispers,
  hinting at the mysteries and dangers hidden within this relentless winter storm.
  To your left and right, the silhouettes of frozen structures emerge sporadically
  from the blizzard, like ghostly sentinels watching over this desolate expanse.

description: A hand-painted sign depicting a smirking squirrel marks this ramshackle
  establishment southeast of the square. Inside, rickety benches face a small wooden
  stage where aspiring performers deliver jokes of questionable quality. The heckling
  is merciless, the acts are forgettable, but somehow everyone keeps coming back.
  Between sets, the crowd trades stories, rumors, and unsolicited advice. The real
  entertainment is not on stage - it is in the conversations happening all around you.

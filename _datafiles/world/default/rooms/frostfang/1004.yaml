title: Snarky Squirrel Commons
description: A hand-painted sign depicting a smirking squirrel marks this ramshackle
  establishment southeast of the square. Inside, rickety benches face a small wooden
  stage where aspiring performers deliver jokes of questionable quality. The heckling
  is merciless, the acts are forgettable, but somehow everyone keeps coming back.
  Between sets, the crowd trades stories, rumors, and unsolicited advice. The real
  entertainment is not on stage - it is in the conversations happening all around you.
  Strange chittering occasionally echoes from the rafters above, though the regulars
  seem to pay it no mind.

nouns:
  bar: The bar is cluttered with half-empty mugs and suspicious stains. The bartender
    keeps one eye on the stage and one on the crowd.
  stage: A rickety wooden platform where dreams go to die. The boards are worn smooth
    by countless hopeful feet.
  benches: The benches have seen better days, their wood scarred with carved initials
    and the occasional crude drawing.
  rafters: The rafters are dark and dusty, but you catch glimpses of movement up there.
    A trap door is barely visible among the beams, leading up into what appears to
    be a hollow tree trunk.
  ceiling: Looking up, you notice a trap door hidden among the rafters. It leads up
    into darkness, and angry chittering echoes from beyond.

title: Guild Master's Office
description: Heavy velvet curtains frame tall windows that look out over the town
  rooftops. An imposing desk of ancient oak dominates the room, its surface covered
  with maps, ledgers, and a collection of stamped seals from a dozen different
  kingdoms. Behind the desk hangs a portrait gallery of former guild masters, their
  painted eyes seeming to follow your movements. A suit of ornate ceremonial armor
  stands guard in one corner, its empty helm tilted as if listening. The current
  guild master's chair sits empty more often than not—administrative duties tend
  to bore the adventurous types who rise to such positions.

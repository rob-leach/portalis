title: Guild Vault Antechamber
description: A narrow stone passage leads to this small, windowless chamber lit only
  by everburning torches set in iron sconces. The walls are etched with protective
  runes that pulse with a faint blue glow, their arcane patterns designed to ward
  off thieves and scrying alike. A massive iron door dominates the far wall, its
  surface covered in intricate locks and binding seals—the entrance to the guild
  vault proper, which remains perpetually sealed to all but the most trusted members.
  A single stone bench offers a place to wait for those summoned here on official
  guild business.

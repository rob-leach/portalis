title: The Bubbling Cauldron
description: Glass vials of every color line the shelves of this aromatic apothecary.
  The air is thick with the mingled scents of dried herbs, exotic roots, and something
  faintly sulfurous bubbling away in a massive iron cauldron at the room's center.
  Bundles of lavender and sage hang from the rafters, and a workbench cluttered with
  mortars, pestles, and stained recipe cards occupies one corner. Amber light filters
  through bottles of mysterious liquids, casting rainbow patterns across the worn
  wooden floor.

title: Hearthstone Cottage
description: A cozy stone cottage stands here, its thatched roof slightly crooked
  with age but meticulously maintained. Smoke curls lazily from a squat chimney,
  carrying the comforting scent of wood fire and fresh-baked bread. A low wooden
  fence surrounds a small garden where herbs and vegetables grow in orderly rows.
  The weathered door bears a carved hearthstone symbol, marking this as a home of
  simple contentment.

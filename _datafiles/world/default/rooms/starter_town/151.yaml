title: First Bank of Starter Town
description: Marble columns support the vaulted ceiling of this secure financial
  institution. Heavy iron bars separate the lobby from the vault area beyond, where
  rows of locked strongboxes glint in the torchlight. A long oak counter runs the
  length of the room, its surface worn smooth by countless transactions. Brass
  plaques on the walls proclaim the bank's founding charter and guarantee the safety
  of all deposits. The faint smell of ink and parchment mingles with the metallic
  tang of coin.

title: Wisteria Cottage
description: Purple wisteria cascades over the arched doorway of this charming
  cottage, its sweet fragrance perfuming the air. The building's honey-colored
  walls glow warmly in the light, and lace curtains flutter behind mullioned
  windows. A worn rocking chair sits on the small porch beside a basket of
  knitting, suggesting the resident stepped away only moments ago. Wind chimes
  fashioned from polished shells tinkle softly in the breeze.

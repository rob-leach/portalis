title: Chapel of the Quiet Star
description: A modest chapel stands at the end of the residential lane, its simple
  wooden doors worn smooth by countless hands seeking solace. A small bell tower
  rises above the peaked roof, housing a bronze bell that marks the hours with
  gentle chimes. Stained glass windows depict a single silver star against a deep
  blue sky, casting colored light across the stone threshold. The air here feels
  peaceful, hushed, as though the very walls hold space for contemplation.

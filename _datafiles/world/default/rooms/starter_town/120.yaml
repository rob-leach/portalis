title: Cobblestone Lane
description: A quiet residential street winds northward from the bustle of the
  training yard. Worn cobblestones, smoothed by generations of footsteps, form
  a gentle path between rows of modest cottages. Window boxes overflow with bright
  geraniums and trailing ivy, adding splashes of color to whitewashed walls. The
  distant clang of practice weapons fades here, replaced by the softer sounds of
  domestic life and the occasional bark of a family dog.

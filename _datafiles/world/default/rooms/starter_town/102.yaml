title: Wizard's Study
description: You enter a cramped but cozy study filled with towering bookshelves
  that reach toward the vaulted ceiling. Leather-bound tomes crowd every available
  surface, their spines inscribed with arcane symbols that seem to shimmer in
  the candlelight. A massive oak desk dominates the center of the room, covered
  in scrolls, inkwells, and mysterious crystalline apparatus. Wisps of colored
  smoke curl lazily from a brazier in the corner, filling the air with the scent
  of exotic incense. Floating motes of light drift near the ceiling, providing
  an ethereal illumination that casts no shadows.

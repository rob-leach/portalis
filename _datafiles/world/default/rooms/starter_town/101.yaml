title: Training Yard
description: A spacious practice yard stretches before you, its packed dirt
  floor marked by countless footprints and the occasional scorch mark. Wooden
  training dummies stand in neat rows along the eastern wall, their surfaces
  battered and splintered from years of use. Weapon racks line the perimeter,
  holding an assortment of practice swords, staffs, and padded gloves. A gruff
  instructor watches over the area, ready to teach the fundamentals of combat
  to any willing student. The clang of practice weapons and determined grunts
  fill the air as aspiring warriors hone their skills.

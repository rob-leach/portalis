title: The Snarky Squirrel Inn
description: A cozy warmth envelops you as you step into this charming tavern.
  Thick wooden beams support a high ceiling, from which hang clusters of dried
  herbs and the occasional lantern. Comfortable booths line the walls, their
  cushions worn soft from years of use. A massive stone fireplace dominates one
  wall, its cheerful flames casting dancing shadows across the room. The bar
  itself is carved from a single enormous log, polished to a warm gleam. Above
  the mantle hangs a painted sign depicting a squirrel with a distinctly smug
  expression. Curiously, the rafters seem to rustle occasionally, and you could
  swear you spot a bushy tail disappearing into the shadows above.

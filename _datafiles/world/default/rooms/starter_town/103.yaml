title: Ranger Outpost
description: A rustic wooden building stands at the edge of town, its walls
  adorned with maps, animal pelts, and various wilderness survival tools. Large
  windows face outward toward the surrounding lands, offering an excellent view
  of approaching travelers and wildlife alike. A heavy table dominates the room,
  covered with detailed regional maps marked with trails, hunting grounds, and
  points of interest. Quivers of arrows hang from pegs, and the faint scent of
  pine and leather permeates the air. A weathered ranger sits in the corner,
  their keen eyes suggesting years of experience tracking through untamed wilderness.

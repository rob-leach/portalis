title: Ironheart Smithy
description: Waves of heat wash over you as you enter this well-worn forge. A massive
  brick furnace dominates the back wall, its coals glowing a fierce orange-red. Racks
  of weapons line the walls - swords, axes, maces, and daggers of varying quality
  and design. Anvils of different sizes stand ready for work, their surfaces pocked
  and scarred from countless hammer blows. The burly smith works tirelessly, muscles
  gleaming with sweat as sparks fly from the blade taking shape beneath their hammer.

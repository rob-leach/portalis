description: A small communal garden occupies this corner of the residential
  quarter, where neighbors gather to tend shared plots of vegetables and flowers.
  Stone benches sit beneath the spreading branches of an ancient oak, its gnarled
  trunk carved with initials and dates spanning decades. A mossy well stands at
  the garden's center, its wooden bucket worn smooth from daily use. This is where
  the community gathers to exchange news, share harvests, and watch children play.

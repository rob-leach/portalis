title: First Bank of Frostfell
description: Marble columns support a vaulted ceiling in this imposing financial
  institution. Iron-barred teller windows line one wall, behind which clerks in
  crisp attire count coins and shuffle documents with practiced efficiency. A massive
  vault door of enchanted steel dominates the far wall, its surface covered in
  glowing protective sigils. Velvet ropes guide customers through an orderly queue,
  while armed guards stand at attention near the entrance. A bronze plaque assures
  patrons that their deposits are protected by both mundane locks and arcane wards.

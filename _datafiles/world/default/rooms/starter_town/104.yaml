description: Shelves packed with supplies line the walls of this modest but
  well-stocked shop. Lanterns, ropes, rations, and countless other necessities
  for the aspiring adventurer fill every available space. A glass counter near
  the entrance displays an assortment of basic weapons and armor, their prices
  clearly marked on small tags. The wooden floor creaks underfoot, worn smooth
  by generations of customers. A portly shopkeeper stands behind the counter,
  a welcoming smile on their face as they polish a dagger with a well-used cloth.
  A small sign reads "Everything an adventurer needs - fair prices guaranteed!"

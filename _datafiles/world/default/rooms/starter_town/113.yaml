title: Steelguard Armory
description: Polished armor gleams from every corner of this meticulously organized
  shop. Mannequins stand at attention wearing everything from simple leather jerkins
  to elaborate plate mail etched with protective runes. Shields bearing various
  crests hang on the walls alongside helmets, gauntlets, and greaves. The smell of
  leather oil and metal polish fills the air. A dignified armorer examines each
  piece with a jeweler's eye, ensuring every rivet and strap meets their exacting
  standards before displaying it for sale.

title: Town Square
description: You stand in the heart of Starter Town, a bustling square where
  cobblestone paths converge around a grand central fountain. Crystal-clear water
  cascades down marble tiers, catching the light and filling the air with a
  pleasant mist. Vendors line the edges of the square, their colorful stalls
  offering everything from fresh bread to mysterious trinkets. Benches carved
  from polished oak invite weary travelers to rest, while cheerful banners
  flutter from lampposts overhead. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, a
  perfect haven for those just beginning their adventures.

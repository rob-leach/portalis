title: Quest Board Chamber
description: A circular chamber dominated by an enormous corkboard that spans nearly
  the entire north wall. Hundreds of parchment notices flutter gently despite the
  still air—job postings, bounties, pleas for help, and the occasional cryptic
  riddle. Worn leather chairs are scattered about, occupied by adventurers studying
  contracts or arguing over party splits. A tired-looking clerk sits at a small
  desk in the corner, stamping completed quest vouchers with mechanical precision.
  Red ink marks the high-priority postings; black crosses strike through those
  already claimed.

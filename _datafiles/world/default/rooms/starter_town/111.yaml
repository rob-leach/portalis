title: Market Square
description: The lane opens into a lively market square where commerce thrives under
  the open sky. A weathered stone well sits at the center, surrounded by merchants
  selling fresh produce, cloth, and curiosities from distant lands. The rhythmic
  clang of hammer on metal echoes from a smithy to the west, while the gleam of
  polished armor beckons from a shop to the east. A sturdy stone building to the
  south bears the unmistakable crest of the Merchant's Guild.

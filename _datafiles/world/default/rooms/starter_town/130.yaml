title: Adventurer's Guild Hall
description: You step through an arched stone doorway into the grand entrance hall
  of the Adventurer's Guild. Polished marble floors reflect the light from ornate
  iron chandeliers hanging overhead. The walls are lined with trophy cases displaying
  relics from legendary expeditions—a dragon's scale here, a demon lord's helm there.
  A reception desk carved from dark mahogany sits near the entrance, perpetually
  unmanned. The air carries the faint scent of leather and old parchment, mingled
  with the distant clink of tankards from somewhere deeper within.

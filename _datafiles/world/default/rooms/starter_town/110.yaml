title: Market Street
description: A bustling cobblestone lane stretches before you, lined with colorful
  merchant stalls and shop fronts. The air hums with the clamor of commerce - vendors
  hawking wares, coins changing hands, and the occasional argument over prices. Striped
  awnings in red and gold provide shade from the sun, while hand-painted signs swing
  overhead advertising everything from exotic spices to enchanted trinkets. To the
  west, aromatic smoke curls from a shop marked by a bubbling cauldron sign. Across
  the way to the east stands a sturdy stone building bearing the seal of the First
  Bank. The street continues south toward the heart of the market district.

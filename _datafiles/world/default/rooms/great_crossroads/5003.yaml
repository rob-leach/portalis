title: Rusted Crossway
description: An ancient road crosses your path here, its stones cracked and
  overgrown with hardy weeds. This was once a major trade route connecting
  the Bladeworks Foundry to distant markets, but commerce died when the
  constructs rose. Rusted signposts point in directions whose destinations
  are no longer readable. The path south continues toward a distant
  intersection where the sky seems brighter.

    reclaiming the road for nature.

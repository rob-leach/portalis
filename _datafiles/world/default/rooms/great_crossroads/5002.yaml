title: The Scarred Wastes
description: The land here bears the wounds of the foundry's past excesses. Deep
  gouges in the earth mark where automated mining constructs once harvested
  ore before the uprising rendered them mindless. Rusted gears and broken cogs
  litter the ground, half-buried in hardpan soil. The path continues south,
  climbing a gentle rise toward cleaner lands. Behind you, the foundry's
  silhouette grows smaller but never disappears completely.

title: The Great Crossroads
description: You have reached the Great Crossroads, a legendary junction where
  paths from across the realm converge. A massive stone platform marks the
  center of the intersection, worn smooth by countless travelers over the ages.
  Roads stretch in every direction - north toward the distant smoke of the
  Bladeworks Foundry, east into unexplored wilderness, south toward lands
  shrouded in mystery, and west where rumors speak of ancient civilizations.
  A weathered wooden signpost stands at the center, its many arms pointing
  toward destinations both known and unknown.

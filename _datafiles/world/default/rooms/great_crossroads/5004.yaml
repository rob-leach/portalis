zone: Great Crossroads
title: The Iron Fields
description: The ground here is studded with fragments of worked iron - old
  weapons, construct parts, and unidentifiable machinery. This must have been
  a battlefield or perhaps a dumping ground for failed foundry creations. Some
  fragments have been arranged into crude cairns, perhaps by travelers seeking
  to mark the path. The road ahead grows more traveled, the footprints more
  recent. The sky brightens noticeably to the south.

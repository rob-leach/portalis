title: Beyond the Foundry
description: You emerge from the Hall of Endless Blades into a landscape scarred
  by industry. The ground here is blackened by centuries of forge-ash and cooling
  runoff from the foundry. Twisted metal spires jut from the earth like the
  bones of dead constructs. The air grows cleaner as you move south, away from
  the smoke-choked depths of the Bladeworks. A worn path leads toward distant
  lands, marked by the footprints of those who conquered the foundry before you.

nouns:
  spires: Twisted metal spires rise from the ashen ground - the remains of
    constructs that wandered too far from the foundry's power source.
  path: A worn dirt path leads south, away from the industrial nightmare
    behind you. The footprints of past adventurers are visible in the ash.
  foundry: The Bladeworks Foundry looms behind you, its smoke stacks still
    belching black clouds into the sky.
idlemessages:
- Ash swirls in a gust of wind from the north.
- A distant clang echoes from the foundry behind you.
- The metal spires creak ominously in the wind.

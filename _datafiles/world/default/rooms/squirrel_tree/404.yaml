title: Eastern Cache
description: This chamber branches off from the main trunk, carved into the heartwood
  by generations of squirrel claws. The walls are lined with hollows stuffed full of
  acorns - this is clearly a major food storage area. Mountains of nuts are piled in
  every corner, some so old they have begun to sprout where they sit. The squirrels
  guard these caches zealously, and you can feel their beady eyes tracking your every
  movement from the shadows.

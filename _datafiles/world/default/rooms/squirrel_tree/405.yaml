title: Western Cache
description: Another storage chamber branches off to the west, this one older and more
  established than its eastern counterpart. The acorn piles here have been carefully
  organized and maintained, sorted by size and freshness with an almost obsessive
  precision. Strange treasures glint among the nuts - bits of glass, a tarnished coin,
  a child's marble - trinkets the squirrels found shiny enough to hoard alongside their
  food. The guardians here are older, more experienced, and even more territorial.

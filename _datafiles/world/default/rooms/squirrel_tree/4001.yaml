title: Tree Entry Hall
description: You have climbed through the trap door in the ceiling of the Snarky Squirrel
  Commons and found yourself in a hollow space within an impossibly large tree trunk.
  The interior walls are smooth, worn wood with claw marks scoring every surface. Acorn
  shells litter the floor, crunching underfoot with each step. Dim light filters down
  from above, revealing a narrow passage ascending into the tree. The air smells of
  sap, fur, and something territorial. This appears to be the entryway to whatever
  creature calls this tree home - and judging by the angry chittering echoing from
  above, the occupants are not pleased with your intrusion.

title: Trunk Ascent
description: The passage narrows as you climb higher through the hollow trunk. Wooden
  footholds have been gnawed into the walls, forming a crude ladder spiraling upward.
  Small nooks and crannies pock the interior, each stuffed with acorns, bits of cloth,
  or unidentifiable treasures squirrels deemed worthy of hoarding. The chittering grows
  louder here, and you catch glimpses of russet fur darting through gaps in the wood.
  The squirrels know you are here, and they are not happy about it.

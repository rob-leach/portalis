title: Canopy Pinnacle
description: You have reached the very top of the great tree, emerging into a chamber
  woven from living branches and leaves. Sunlight filters through the canopy above,
  dappling everything in shifting green and gold. This is the throne room of the
  squirrel kingdom - a great nest of twigs, leaves, and stolen cloth dominates the
  center, clearly the seat of whoever rules this arboreal domain. The chittering
  here is deafening, a chorus of fury at your trespass into the heart of their territory.
  Acorns are scattered everywhere, offerings to whatever power holds court here. This
  is the end of the road - there is nowhere left to climb.

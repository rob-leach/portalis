title: Upper Trunk
description: You have climbed into the upper reaches of the tree trunk, where the wood
  thins and daylight filters through cracks in the bark. The passage continues upward
  toward what must be the canopy, but the going is treacherous - the footholds are
  smaller here, clearly designed for creatures far lighter than you. Squirrel activity
  has intensified; you can see them darting along branches visible through gaps in the
  trunk, their chittering reaching a fever pitch at your continued intrusion.

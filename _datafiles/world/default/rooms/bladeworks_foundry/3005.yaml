title: The Grinding Hall
description: This long hall is dominated by massive grinding wheels mounted along
  both walls. Some still spin slowly, their stone surfaces worn smooth from
  sharpening countless blades. Sparks occasionally fly as errant metal scraps
  are caught in the wheels. The floor is thick with metal filings that crunch
  underfoot like iron snow. Overhead, a magnificent chandelier holds dozens of
  finished swords arranged in a spiral pattern, turning slowly in the heat
  rising from below. Water troughs run along the base of the grinders, meant
  for cooling blades but now stagnant and rust-colored.

title: Tempering Pools
description: A series of deep pools fill this chamber, once used for quenching
  and tempering hot-forged blades. Some pools still bubble with mysterious oils,
  others hold stagnant water that gleams with metallic rainbows. Chains and
  hooks hang from the ceiling, designed to lower blades into the pools with
  precise timing. The walls are scorched from decades of hot metal being plunged
  into liquid. A massive sword-chandelier hangs directly over the central pool,
  its glass blades dripping with condensation from the steam that constantly
  rises from below.

title: Steam Works
description: Massive boilers and pipes fill this chamber, the power source for the
  entire foundry. Steam vents from countless joints and valves, creating a
  perpetual fog that obscures vision. The heat is nearly unbearable, and the
  constant hiss of escaping pressure makes communication difficult. Catwalks
  span the pipes at multiple levels, many rusted through and dangerous. This
  is where the steam golems were born, their bodies filled with superheated
  vapor from these eternal boilers. The sword-chandeliers here are made of
  burnished bronze, resistant to the corrosive steam.

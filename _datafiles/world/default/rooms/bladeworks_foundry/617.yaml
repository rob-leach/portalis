title: The Control Nexus
description: This chamber houses the magical and mechanical systems that control
  the foundry's constructs. Crystal matrices pulse with arcane energy, connected
  to copper wires that snake throughout the building. Control panels line the
  walls, their levers and dials still active. This is where the constructs
  received their orders - and where, presumably, something went terribly wrong.
  A massive central crystal, cracked and flickering, seems to be the source
  of the constructs' continued animation. The sword-chandeliers here incorporate
  crystal elements, their blades humming with residual magical energy.

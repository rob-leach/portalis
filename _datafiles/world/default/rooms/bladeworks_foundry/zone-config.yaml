  - The rhythmic clang of distant machinery echoes through the halls.
  - Steam hisses from a crack in the pipes somewhere nearby.
  - A gear grinds against metal, sending sparks into the dim light.
  - Sword-shaped chandeliers sway gently, their glass blades catching the forge light.
  - The acrid smell of hot metal and oil hangs heavy in the air.
  - A construct's footsteps clank somewhere in the distance.
  - Spinning saw blades whir ominously from behind a wall.
  - The furnaces roar with eternal flame, hungry for more steel.

title: The Smelting Chamber
description: Enormous furnaces line the walls of this sweltering chamber, their
  fires still burning despite years of abandonment. Vats of molten metal glow
  orange and red, bubbling with eternal heat. Mechanical arms hang from the
  ceiling on tracks, designed to pour molten steel into blade molds below.
  Some arms still jerk and twitch, splashing dangerous drops of liquid metal
  across the floor. The sword-chandeliers here are made of actual metal blades,
  their edges glinting wickedly in the forge-light. Catwalks crisscross overhead,
  leading to controls that no longer have operators.

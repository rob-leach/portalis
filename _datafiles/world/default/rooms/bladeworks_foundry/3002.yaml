title: The Receiving Bay
description: This cavernous chamber once received raw materials for the foundry's
  hungry forges. Rusted conveyor belts stretch across the floor like metal
  serpents, some still jerking forward in fits and starts. Crates of unprocessed
  ore and ingots lie scattered about, many torn open by mechanical claws. Along
  the walls, sorting machines click and whir mindlessly, their gears grinding
  without purpose. A sword-chandelier hangs from chains above, its glass blades
  still intact and glowing faintly from the forge-light that filters in from
  the south.

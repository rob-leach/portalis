title: The Master's Study
description: This was the private study of the foundry's master artificer, the
  genius who designed the constructs and dreamed of a world where weapons forged
  themselves. Bookshelves line the walls, filled with treatises on metallurgy,
  construct animation, and blade enchantment. A massive desk holds unfinished
  designs - the last projects the master was working on before the uprising.
  One blueprint shows a three-bladed sword, its design revolutionary but
  incomplete. The sword-chandelier here is a personal masterwork, holding the
  artificer's own collection of experimental blades.

title: Component Stockpile
description: This storage room once held the components needed to build the foundry's
  construct workforce. Now it serves as a graveyard for damaged and defunct
  machines. Piles of gears, springs, and mechanical limbs litter the floor.
  Shelves hold jars of lubricating oils, most dried or congealed. A workbench
  in the corner still has partially-assembled constructs lying upon it, frozen
  mid-creation. The sword-chandelier here is made entirely of discarded blade
  components - hilts, guards, and pommels arranged in artistic chaos.

  workbench: The workbench holds partially assembled constructs, their empty
    eye-sockets staring at nothing.
  shelves: Shelves of oils and lubricants line the walls, most containers
    cracked or empty.
  chandelier: This chandelier is assembled from sword components - hilts,
    guards, and pommels forming an abstract sculpture.
idlemessages:
- Gears shift and settle, disturbed by vibrations from distant machinery.
- A jar of oil slowly drips onto the floor with a soft plop.

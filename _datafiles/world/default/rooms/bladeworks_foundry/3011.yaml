title: Foreman's Office
description: This small office overlooks the tempering pools through thick glass
  windows, now cracked and grimy. A heavy desk sits in the center, covered with
  yellowed production orders and inventory lists. The walls are decorated with
  blueprints for various blade designs and construct schematics. A small
  sword-chandelier hangs from the ceiling, its glass blades more delicate than
  those in the production areas. This was where the foundry's foreman directed
  operations - before the constructs turned on their masters.

nouns:
  desk: The foreman's desk is covered with old paperwork - production quotas,
    maintenance schedules, and one ominous note about "unusual construct behavior."
  windows: Thick glass windows overlook the tempering pools below. Cracks
    spiderweb across their surface.
  blueprints: Blueprints for blade designs and construct schematics paper the
    walls, some torn or defaced.
  chandelier: This chandelier is more elegant than the industrial versions,
    befitting an office space.

- Papers rustle in a draft from a crack in the window.
- The chair behind the desk creaks as if someone just stood up.

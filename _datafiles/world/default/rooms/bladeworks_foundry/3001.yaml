title: Foundry Entrance
description: A massive iron door, scarred by countless blade-strikes, hangs half-open
  on rusted hinges. Beyond lies the Bladeworks Foundry, a once-legendary weapons
  manufactory now fallen to ruin and overrun by its own creations. The walls are
  lined with decorative sword displays, though many blades have been torn from
  their mounts. A sword-shaped chandelier hangs crookedly overhead, its glass
  blade-arms casting fractured light across the dusty floor. The air is thick
  with the smell of old oil and hot metal. Faded signs warn of "AUTHORIZED
  ARTIFICERS ONLY" and "BLADE HAZARD ZONE."

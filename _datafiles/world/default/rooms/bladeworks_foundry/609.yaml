title: The Assembly Line
description: This is the heart of the foundry's production floor - a massive
  assembly line where components came together to form finished weapons. Conveyor
  belts crisscross the chamber at multiple levels, some still moving. Mechanical
  arms stand poised at each station, ready to attach hilts, wrap handles, or
  sharpen edges. Racks of partially completed weapons line the walls in various
  states of assembly. The sword-chandeliers here hang in a row down the center
  of the line, each one holding progressively more complete blade forms, from
  raw metal to finished sword. This is where the constructs learned to build -
  and eventually, to fight.

  racks: Racks of incomplete weapons line the walls - blades without hilts,
    hilts without guards, guards without pommels.

    holds progressively more complete weapons.

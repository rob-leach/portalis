title: The Dueling Gallery
description: This elegant chamber stands in stark contrast to the industrial chaos
  elsewhere in the foundry. Polished marble floors bear the scuffs of countless
  practice bouts. Mirrors line the walls, allowing duelists to observe their
  own form. Weapon racks hold an impressive array of training blades, many
  designed for dual-wielding practice. At the far end, a raised platform serves
  as an instructor's station. The sword-chandeliers here are masterworks -
  actual functional blades suspended in perfect balance, ready to be drawn in
  an emergency. This was where the foundry's artificers learned to TEST their
  creations. Those who survived the deeper forges often came here to master
  fighting with two blades at once.

title: Mold Storage
description: Rows of heavy iron shelves fill this chamber, holding countless blade
  molds of every conceivable design. Swords, daggers, axes, spears - the foundry
  could produce any edged weapon imaginable. Some molds lie broken on the floor,
  their forms cracked and useless. Others still hold cooled metal, half-formed
  blades frozen in the process of creation. A thick layer of dust covers
  everything, disturbed only by the tracks of wandering constructs. The
  sword-chandelier here is particularly ornate, featuring miniature replicas
  of famous legendary blades.

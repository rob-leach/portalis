roomid: 607
zone: Bladeworks Foundry
title: Quality Control Chamber
description: This chamber was where the foundry's blades were tested and inspected.
  Target dummies made of straw and leather stand in rows, all thoroughly
  shredded by countless blade tests. Mechanical arms mounted on rails can swing
  weapons at various speeds and angles, testing edge retention and balance.
  Several arms still hold rusted blades, frozen mid-swing. Along one wall, a
  rack displays blades that failed inspection - cracked, bent, or poorly
  tempered. The sword-chandelier overhead is made from broken blades, a fitting
  decoration for this chamber of imperfection.

title: The Blade Gate
description: A massive gateway marks the transition from the production floors to
  the deeper foundry. The gate itself is made entirely of interlocking swords,
  their hilts forming the hinges and their blades the bars. It stands half-open,
  jammed in place by the twisted body of a destroyed construct. Beyond, the air
  grows hotter and the lighting more erratic. The sword-chandeliers past this
  point are made of larger, more dangerous blades - clearly meant as weapons,
  not decorations. A warning plaque beside the gate reads "HALL OF ENDLESS
  BLADES - MASTER ARTIFICERS ONLY."

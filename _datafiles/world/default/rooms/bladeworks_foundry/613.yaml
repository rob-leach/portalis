zone: Bladeworks Foundry
title: The Proving Grounds
description: This vast chamber was where the foundry's most powerful constructs
  were tested in actual combat. The floor is scarred with blade marks and
  gouged by heavy impacts. Destroyed constructs litter the edges of the room,
  pushed aside to clear the fighting space. Blade-walls - spinning barriers
  of razor-sharp metal - can emerge from slots in the floor, though most are
  jammed or broken. The sword-chandeliers here are massive, holding great
  swords and battle axes instead of mere daggers. Viewing galleries line the
  upper walls, where artificers once watched their creations fight.

nouns:
  floor: The floor bears the scars of countless battles - blade gouges, impact
    craters, and rust stains that might be oil or blood.
  constructs: Destroyed constructs are piled at the room's edges, a graveyard
    of failed experiments.
  galleries: Viewing galleries overlook the proving grounds, their seats dusty
    and abandoned.
  blade-walls: Slots in the floor once deployed spinning blade barriers. Most
    are jammed, but some still twitch dangerously.
idlemessages:
- A blade-wall slot sparks and tries to deploy, then jams.
- Metal debris shifts as something moves beneath the wreckage.
- The great sword chandelier sways, its massive blades groaning.
- Echoes of ancient battles seem to ring through the chamber.

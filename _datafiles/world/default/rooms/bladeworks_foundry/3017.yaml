zone: Bladeworks Foundry
title: The Blade Garden
description: This chamber defies explanation - thousands of swords grow from the
  floor like metal flowers, their blades reaching toward the ceiling in eerie
  stillness. This was an experiment by the foundry's master artificers, an
  attempt to grow weapons rather than forge them. The experiment succeeded
  beyond their wildest dreams - and worst nightmares. The blades continue to
  grow, slowly filling the chamber over decades. Walking here requires extreme
  care, as blades sprout everywhere. The sword-chandeliers are unnecessary -
  the blade-flowers themselves catch and reflect light throughout the chamber.

  blades: The blade-flowers grow in impossibly delicate formations, their
    edges sharp enough to cut on contact.
  floor: The floor is barely visible beneath the forest of growing blades.
    Each step must be planned carefully.
  experiment: Signs of the original experiment remain - alchemical residue,
    growth chambers, and notes about "metallurgical botany."
idlemessages:
- A blade-flower grows a fraction of an inch with a soft ringing sound.
- Light dances across the chamber, reflected by countless edges.
- A gentle chime rings as blades touch in the stillness.
- New blade-buds push up through the floor with tiny metallic pings.

  name: blade dancer
  description: This sleek construct was designed for speed and precision above all
    else. Its body is a narrow frame of articulated steel, giving it uncanny
    agility and grace. Where hands should be, twin daggers extend directly from
    its wrists, permanently affixed and razor-sharp. Its legs are spring-loaded
    for quick lunges and rapid retreats. A single glowing red eye serves as
    both sensor and soul, tracking movement with predatory intensity. The blade
    dancer was meant to demonstrate the foundry's products - now it demonstrates
    only violence.

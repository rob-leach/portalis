  name: gear grinder
  description: This nightmarish construct was designed to recycle damaged equipment
    and failed weapons. Its body is essentially a mobile grinding machine - a
    massive central cavity filled with interlocking gear-teeth that can reduce
    solid steel to shavings in seconds. Heavy treads support its bulk, and
    multiple grabbing arms can seize objects (or victims) and feed them into
    its grinding maw. The gear grinder moves slowly but inexorably, and the
    screech of its internal mechanisms can be heard throughout the foundry.
    It no longer distinguishes between scrap metal and living intruders.

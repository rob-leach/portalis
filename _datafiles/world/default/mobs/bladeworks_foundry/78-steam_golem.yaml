character:
  name: steam golem
  description: The steam golem represents the pinnacle of the foundry's heavy
    combat designs. Standing ten feet tall, its body is a walking boiler system
    - brass and iron plates encase a superheated steam engine that powers its
    every movement. Piston-driven arms can deliver crushing blows, and vents
    throughout its body can release scalding steam as both weapon and defense.
    A constant hiss accompanies its movements as pressure is vented and built
    in an endless cycle. The steam golem's chest cavity glows orange with
    internal heat, and its eye-lenses are fogged with its own moisture.

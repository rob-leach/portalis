character:
  name: Voltaic Promethean
  description: The Voltaic Promethean is the foundry's ultimate creation, a
    fifteen-foot titan of steel and lightning that was meant to revolutionize
    both warfare and industry. Its body is covered in interlocking blades that
    serve as both armor and weapon, each one capable of channeling the electrical
    energy that animates its form. A central dynamo in its chest generates
    constant power, visible through gaps in its armor as crackling blue-white
    lightning. Its eyes are twin orbs of pure electrical discharge, seeing
    through currents rather than light. The Promethean was designed to think,
    to create, to forge new weapons from raw materials using only its own body.
    Instead, it became the instrument of the foundry's downfall - a creation
    too powerful to control, too intelligent to serve. Now it rules the Hall
    of Endless Blades, a steel god awaiting challengers.

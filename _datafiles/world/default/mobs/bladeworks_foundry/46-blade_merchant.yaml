character:
  name: blade merchant
  description: This cloaked figure has made a dangerous living salvaging and selling
    weapons from the depths of the Bladeworks Foundry. Their face is hidden beneath
    a deep hood, and their hands are covered in thick leather gloves scarred by
    countless small cuts. A massive pack on their back clinks with metal, filled
    with blades of every description. They move with the careful, quiet steps
    of someone who has learned to avoid the attention of constructs. Despite
    the danger, they seem almost cheerful - the foundry's lost treasures fetch
    incredible prices, and they have exclusive access to the supply. The blade
    merchant knows every safe route through the foundry, every hiding spot, and
    every construct patrol pattern.

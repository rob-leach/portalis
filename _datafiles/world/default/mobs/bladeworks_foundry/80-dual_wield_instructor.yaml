  name: dual-wield instructor
  description: This weathered warrior is one of the few survivors of the Bladeworks
    Foundry's catastrophic fall. Her arms bear the scars of countless blade wounds,
    yet she moves with fluid grace that speaks of decades of training. She wears
    practical leather armor reinforced with metal plates scavenged from destroyed
    constructs. At her hips hang twin swords of exceptional quality, their edges
    mirror-bright despite years of use. Her eyes constantly scan for threats,
    a habit born of surviving in a place where everything wants to kill you.
    She remained here not out of madness, but out of purpose - the Dueling
    Gallery is the finest training ground for dual-wielding in the known world,
    and she will not abandon it to the machines.

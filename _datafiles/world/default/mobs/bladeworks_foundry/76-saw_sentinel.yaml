character:
  name: saw sentinel
  description: Built for defense and area denial, the saw sentinel is a rolling
    fortress of spinning death. Its lower body is mounted on heavy treads that
    allow it to move with surprising stability. Both arms terminate in massive
    circular saw blades that can spin at tremendous speeds, creating an
    impassable barrier of cutting edges. Its torso is heavily armored, designed
    to withstand punishment while it holds its ground. Multiple optical sensors
    give it 360-degree awareness. The saw sentinel was meant to guard high-value
    areas - and it still does, though its masters are long gone.

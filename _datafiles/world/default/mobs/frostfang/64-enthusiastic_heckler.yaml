character:
  name: enthusiastic heckler
  description: Planted firmly in a front-row seat, this loud patron seems to derive
    more joy from heckling performers than from any actual comedy. Their voice
    carries across the room with practiced projection, and they have an inexhaustible
    supply of references to local landmarks and happenings to weave into their
    insults.

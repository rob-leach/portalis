character:
  name: failed comedian
  description: This performer has the haunted look of someone who has died on stage
    one too many times. Their threadbare costume was probably colorful once, and
    their forced smile does not quite reach their eyes. Between bitter observations
    about their career, they seem to know an awful lot about what is happening around
    Frostfang.

  - 'say The Bladeworks Foundry... they say there are only THREE of some legendary blade there. Most curious.'

character:
  name: Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light
  description: This elderly wizard wears flowing robes of deep blue adorned with silver
    stars and moons. His long white beard reaches nearly to his waist, and his
    pointed hat sits slightly askew atop his head. He carries a gnarled oak staff
    topped with a softly glowing crystal, and a worn leather satchel bulges with
    scrolls and maps. His eyes twinkle with barely contained enthusiasm as he
    speaks of dungeons, monsters, and legendary treasures. He seems to know an
    awful lot about the layout of the world, almost as if he designed it himself.

  name: ranger trainer
  description: 'A lean, weathered ranger clad in practical leathers dyed in mottled
    greens and browns. Their keen eyes miss nothing, constantly scanning their
    surroundings with the practiced awareness of one who has spent years tracking
    prey through untamed wilderness. A longbow rests within easy reach, its wood
    worn smooth from countless hunts. Various pouches and tools hang from their belt -
    a compass, lengths of cord, dried herbs, and a well-worn hunting knife. Faded
    scars on their hands tell of close encounters with wild beasts, while their
    quiet demeanor suggests a preference for observation over conversation. They
    are clearly an expert in navigation, tracking, and wilderness survival.'

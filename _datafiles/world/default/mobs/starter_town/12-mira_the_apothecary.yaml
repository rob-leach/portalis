  name: Mira the Apothecary
  description: 'A wiry woman of indeterminate age, her silver-streaked hair pulled
    back in a practical bun secured with a copper pin shaped like a serpent. Her
    fingers are stained with countless reagents, and her sharp green eyes miss
    nothing. She wears a heavy leather apron over simple homespun clothes, its
    pockets bulging with corked vials and dried herbs. Despite her somewhat wild
    appearance, there is a reassuring competence in her movements as she tends
    to her bubbling concoctions.'

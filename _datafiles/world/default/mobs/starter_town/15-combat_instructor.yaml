  name: combat instructor
  description: 'A grizzled veteran with numerous battle scars crisscrossing their
    weathered face and thick forearms. Their nose has been broken more times than
    they can count, and calloused knuckles speak to decades of bare-fisted combat.
    Despite their fearsome appearance, their eyes hold a patient wisdom earned through
    countless training sessions. A sleeveless tunic reveals corded muscles that still
    ripple with dangerous power. They watch newcomers with an appraising eye, ready
    to teach the fundamentals of brawling to those willing to learn.'

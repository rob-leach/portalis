  description: 'A scruffy rat the size of a small cat, its matted brown fur
    patched with bald spots and scars from countless scuffles. Beady red eyes
    gleam with malevolent cunning as it surveys its surroundings, whiskers
    twitching constantly. Its yellowed teeth look sharp enough to gnaw through
    leather, and a long naked tail drags behind it like a pink worm. This
    vermin has clearly grown bold from scavenging in town, showing no fear
    of adventurers who cross its path.'

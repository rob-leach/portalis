  name: town guard
  description: 'A sturdy guard clad in practical chainmail over a green tabard
    bearing the town crest. Their well-maintained spear rests casually against
    one shoulder, ready to be brought to bear at a moment''s notice. Keen eyes
    constantly survey the surroundings from beneath a simple iron helm, watching
    for any sign of trouble. Despite their vigilant demeanor, there''s a friendly
    set to their jaw that suggests they''d rather share a drink than crack skulls.
    Years of patrol have left them with an easy confidence and a reputation for
    fair dealing.'

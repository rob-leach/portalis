  name: Aldric the Banker
  description: 'A portly gentleman in immaculate attire, his dark wool coat
    buttoned precisely over a crisp white shirt. Gold-rimmed spectacles perch
    on his bulbous nose, and his thinning hair is slicked back with fragrant
    pomade. Ink-stained fingers speak to long hours with ledgers and contracts,
    while a heavy ring of keys hangs at his belt. His expression maintains
    professional neutrality, though his eyes light up at the mention of
    substantial deposits.'

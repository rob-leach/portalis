  name: resident wizard
  description: 'An elderly mage wrapped in flowing robes of deep blue, embroidered
    with silver threads that form constellations when viewed from the right angle.
    A long white beard cascades down their chest, occasionally sparking with residual
    magical energy. Their eyes gleam with arcane knowledge, appearing to shift colors
    from violet to gold depending on the light. Gnarled fingers adorned with several
    rings of power gesture constantly as they speak, leaving trails of faint luminescence
    in the air. They carry themselves with the quiet confidence of one who has mastered
    the fundamental arts of spellcasting.'

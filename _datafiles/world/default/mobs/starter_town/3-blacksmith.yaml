character:
  name: blacksmith
  description: A barrel-chested smith with arms like tree trunks, their muscles
    rippling beneath skin darkened by years of forge-work. Soot streaks their
    leather apron and thick protective gloves, while beads of sweat glisten on
    their bald head. Despite the intimidating physique, warm brown eyes and a
    quick smile suggest a craftsman who takes genuine pride in their work. A
    massive hammer rests within easy reach, more tool than weapon but certainly
    capable of cracking skulls if needed.

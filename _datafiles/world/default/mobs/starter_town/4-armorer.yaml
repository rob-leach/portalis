  description: A dignified craftsperson with silver-streaked hair pulled back in
    a practical bun. Sharp grey eyes miss nothing as they assess each customer,
    mentally calculating measurements before a word is spoken. Their hands are
    surprisingly delicate for someone who works with metal and leather, each
    finger bearing the calluses of precision work rather than brute labor. A
    measuring tape drapes around their neck like a badge of office, and their
    immaculate leather vest displays an array of specialized tools in neat loops.

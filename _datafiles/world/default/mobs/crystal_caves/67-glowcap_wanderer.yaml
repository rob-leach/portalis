  name: glowcap wanderer
  description: This ambulatory fungus moves on a mass of root-like tendrils, its pace
    slow but purposeful. Its cap is broad and dome-shaped, glowing with an intense
    teal bioluminescence that pulses in a slow rhythm. The gills beneath the cap
    continuously release drifting spores that sparkle in the air like fairy dust.
    Its stem is thick and pale, marked with concentric rings that may indicate its
    considerable age. Two darker patches on the stem give the unsettling impression
    of eyes, though whether the creature can actually see is uncertain. It seems
    peaceful unless provoked.

character:
  name: Crystalseer
  description: The Crystalseer is an ancient sprite who has dwelt among the crystals for
    so long that she has become partly crystalline herself. Her wings are lattices of
    pure crystal, refracting light into rainbow patterns, and her skin has taken on a
    translucent quality that reveals glimpses of inner light. Her eyes are the most
    striking feature, faceted like perfectly cut gems, able to see not just the present
    but echoes of past and future reflected in the crystals around her. She speaks in
    a melodic voice that resonates like a singing bowl, and she possesses knowledge
    accumulated over countless centuries. She is willing to share the art of crystal
    sight with those who approach with respect and an open mind.

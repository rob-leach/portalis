character:
  name: crystal beetle
  description: This beetle is unlike any surface-dwelling insect. Its carapace is composed
    of interlocking crystal plates that catch and refract light, creating a constantly
    shifting pattern of colors across its surface. Its legs are jointed crystal, clicking
    against the stone floor as it moves, and its mandibles are razor-sharp formations
    capable of shearing through rock. Most remarkably, its compound eyes glow with a
    soft blue luminescence, suggesting some form of internal light source. Despite its
    alien appearance, it moves with the purposeful efficiency common to all beetles.

  description: This diminutive being appears to be made of condensed light and crystal
    dust. It flutters on wings of translucent crystal, each wingbeat releasing a shower
    of luminescent particles. Its body is humanoid but tiny, no larger than your hand,
    with features that shift and change like light through a prism. Its eyes are deep
    pools of violet light, ancient and knowing despite its playful demeanor. The sprite
    leaves a faint trail of sparkles wherever it flies, and the air around it carries
    a faint tinkling sound, like distant wind chimes.

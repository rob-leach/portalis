character:
  name: Crystal Matriarch
  description: The Crystal Matriarch is a being of terrible beauty and ancient power.
    Her form is that of a towering humanoid composed entirely of living crystal, but
    where the guardians are crude assemblages, she is a masterwork of natural artistry.
    Her body flows with lines of golden light, and her face, though crystalline, bears
    features of haunting elegance. A crown of razor-sharp crystal spires rises from
    her head, and her eyes are twin amethysts that hold the weight of ages. She moves
    with fluid grace despite her size, each gesture trailing motes of light. She is
    the mother of all crystal life in these caves, and she has protected her children
    for millennia. Those who threaten her domain will learn the true meaning of eternal
    patience turned to wrath.

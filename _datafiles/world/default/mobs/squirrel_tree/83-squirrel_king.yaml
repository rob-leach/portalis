  name: Squirrel King
  description: This battle-scarred squirrel stands larger than any of his subjects,
    his russet fur streaked with silver and marked by the scars of countless territorial
    disputes. One eye is milky white from an old wound, but the other burns with fierce
    intelligence and fury. Upon his head rests a crown woven from acorn caps, held
    together with bits of spider silk and bark - crude but unmistakably regal. His
    bushy tail, torn and scarred but still magnificent, sweeps behind him like a
    banner of war. This is no ordinary squirrel - this is a king who has clawed his
    way to the top of the tree through tooth and claw, and he will not suffer
    trespassers in his domain.

name: three-bladed sword
namesimple: unusual sword
description: An impractical but undeniably impressive weapon featuring three parallel
  blades welded to a single hilt. The merchant who sold this swore each blade was
  worth exactly one hundred gold. The awkward balance makes it slower to swing, but
  you have to admit - it looks absolutely magnificent.

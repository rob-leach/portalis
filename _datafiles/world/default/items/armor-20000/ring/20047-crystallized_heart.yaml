description: This ring is carved from a single piece of rose-tinted crystal that
  pulses with a slow, steady rhythm like a heartbeat. It is said to contain the
  essence of the caves themselves, a fragment of the magical matrix that sustains
  all crystal life in the depths. The wearer finds their own vitality enhanced,
  wounds closing faster and stamina lasting longer, as if the crystal shares its
  ancient life force.

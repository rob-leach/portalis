description: This suit of armor was forged from salvaged plates of the Voltaic
  Promethean's body. The interlocking blade-panels provide exceptional
  protection while allowing full range of motion. Residual electrical energy
  crackles across its surface, and the armor seems to repair minor damage
  on its own over time. Wearing it fills you with a strange confidence,
  as if the Promethean's indomitable will has become your own.

namesimple: crown
description: A crude but surprisingly impressive crown woven from acorn caps and held
  together with bits of spider silk and bark. It once adorned the head of the Squirrel
  King himself, ruler of the great tree above the Snarky Squirrel Commons. Though it
  has no magical properties, it serves as proof that you bested the most territorial
  rodent in all of Frostfang. Wearing it might earn you strange looks, but also perhaps
  a measure of respect from those who know its origin.

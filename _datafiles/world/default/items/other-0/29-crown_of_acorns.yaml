description: A crude but surprisingly impressive crown woven from acorn caps and held
  together with bits of spider silk and bark. It once adorned the head of the Squirrel
  King himself, ruler of the great tree above the Snarky Squirrel Commons. Wearing
  it fills you with jittery, squirrel-like energy - your reflexes quicken but your
  focus suffers. It earns strange looks, but also respect from those who know its origin.

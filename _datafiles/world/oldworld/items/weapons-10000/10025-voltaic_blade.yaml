description: This crackling sword was forged from the remains of the Voltaic
  Promethean itself. Lightning constantly arcs along its edge, leaving
  afterimages in the air with every swing. The blade seems almost alive,
  humming with electrical energy that responds to its wielder's emotions.
  Those who wield it report feeling a strange connection to the foundry
  itself, as if the Promethean's consciousness lingers within the steel.

  name: angry squirrel
  description: This plump russet squirrel is absolutely FURIOUS at your intrusion into
    its territory. Its beady black eyes glare at you with surprising intensity, and
    its bushy tail puffs up to twice its normal size in a display of aggression. Tiny
    but razor-sharp teeth are bared in a perpetual snarl, and its claws click menacingly
    against the wood. What it lacks in size, it makes up for in sheer territorial rage
    and an apparent willingness to call every friend it has to swarm intruders.

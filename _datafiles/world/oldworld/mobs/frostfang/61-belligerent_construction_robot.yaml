  name: belligerent construction robot
  description: This towering mechanical monstrosity stands eight feet tall, a nightmarish
    fusion of arcane engineering and industrial brutality. Its body is a patchwork
    of riveted iron plates and brass fittings, scarred by countless repairs. Steam
    hisses from pressure valves along its spine, while gears grind audibly within
    its torso. A single cyclopean optical sensor glows an angry red from its angular
    head, constantly scanning for intruders. One arm terminates in a massive pneumatic
    pile-driver, the other in a crackling tesla coil that arcs with barely-contained
    lightning. Painted across its chest in faded yellow letters CONSTRUCTION ZONE
    VIOLATORS WILL BE REMOVED. Orange warning lights pulse rhythmically from its
    shoulders, and a tinny speaker occasionally crackles with distorted warnings
    about restricted access.

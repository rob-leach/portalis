character:
  name: squirrel janitor
  description: This weathered worker shuffles through the venue with a mop and a faraway
    look. He has heard every bad joke performed here and seems to remember them all,
    muttering punchlines and references to himself as he cleans. The comedians come
    and go, but the janitor remains.

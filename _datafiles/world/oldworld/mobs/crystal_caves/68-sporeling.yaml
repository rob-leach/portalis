  description: This small fungal creature is clearly juvenile, its cap barely formed
    and its locomotion uncertain. It toddles about on three stubby leg-tendrils,
    frequently losing its balance and having to right itself. Its glow is dimmer
    than the adult wanderers, a soft violet rather than bright teal, and its spore
    production is erratic, releasing in sudden puffs rather than steady streams.
    Despite its clumsy appearance, there's something almost endearing about the
    little creature as it explores its environment with apparent curiosity.

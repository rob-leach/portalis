  name: crystal guardian
  description: This construct appears to be an animate collection of crystal formations,
    vaguely humanoid in shape but with no clear distinction between body and armor.
    Its form is constantly shifting, crystals sliding and reforming to adapt to movement.
    Where a face might be, there is only a smooth plane of crystal with a single
    glowing point that serves as an eye. Its arms end in formations that could be
    interpreted as hands or weapons, and when it moves, the sound is like a wind chime
    played by a hurricane. This guardian has protected these caves since time beyond
    memory, and it will not suffer intruders lightly.

title: The Hall of Endless Blades
description: You have entered the legendary Hall of Endless Blades, the chamber
  that gave this dungeon its fearsome reputation. The walls, floor, and ceiling
  are covered - no, MADE of blades. Swords of every design interlock to form
  the very structure of the room. In the center stands the Voltaic Promethean,
  the foundry's ultimate creation - a towering construct of gleaming steel and
  crackling lightning, its form a perfect fusion of blade and electricity. This
  was meant to be the foundry's masterpiece, a construct that could forge,
  fight, and think. Instead, it became their doom. The sword-chandelier above
  is the largest in the foundry - a spiral of a thousand blades descending from
  the ceiling, crackling with the same lightning that animates the Promethean.
  A breach in the southern wall leads to lands beyond the foundry.

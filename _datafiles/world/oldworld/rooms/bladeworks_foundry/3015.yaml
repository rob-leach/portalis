title: The Weapon Vault
description: Reinforced steel walls surround this chamber, designed to contain
  the foundry's most valuable and dangerous creations. Display cases line the
  walls, most smashed open and emptied. A few still hold weapons of remarkable
  craftsmanship - blades that glow with inner light, edges that seem to cut
  the very air. A hidden merchant has made their home here, trading in the
  foundry's lost treasures to those brave enough to reach this deep. The
  sword-chandelier here is made of the foundry's finest work - masterwork
  blades that sing when air passes through them.

title: Supply Corridor
description: A narrow corridor connects the receiving bay to the storage areas.
  The walls are lined with racks that once held tools and components, now mostly
  empty or scattered across the floor. Spinning saw blades are embedded in the
  walls at regular intervals, part of an old security system that still activates
  sporadically. Glass sword-sconces provide flickering illumination, several
  cracked and dark. The floor bears countless scratches from the passage of
  metal feet.

nouns:
  racks: Empty tool racks line the walls. Whatever was stored here has long
    since been taken or destroyed.
  saws: Circular saw blades spin in wall-mounted housings, a deadly security
    measure that still functions erratically.
  sconces: The glass sconces are shaped like upturned swords, their pommels
    holding small flames.

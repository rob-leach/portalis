title: Stormwatchers Keep
description: Standing at the edge of the Stormwatchers Keep, the world unfolds in
  a breathtaking panorama. The landscape stretches into the horizon, but the way
  north into the Keep itself has been barricaded. Where once a large iron door
  offered entry to the formidable fortress, now a massive construction barrier has
  been erected, completely sealing the passage. The barrier is covered in warning
  signs and pulsing arcane lights, and chains as thick as an arm crisscross its
  surface. Through gaps in the plating, you can see only swirling mist where the
  Keep interior should be.

  barrier: The construction barrier completely blocks access to the Keep. It has
    been built directly over the old iron door, which can still be glimpsed beneath
    layers of new plating and warning signs.
  barricade: :barrier
  door: The old iron door is still visible beneath the barrier, but it has been
    welded shut and covered with additional plating. Whatever is happening inside,
    they clearly do not want visitors.
  chains: Massive chains have been wrapped around the barrier, their links glowing
    faintly with containment runes. These are not just keeping people out - they
    might be keeping something in.
  signs: The signs warn of TEMPORAL REALIGNMENT IN PROGRESS and that the KEEP
    INTERIOR CURRENTLY EXISTS IN MULTIPLE TIMESTREAMS. Entry may result in paradox.
  mist: Through the gaps in the barrier, swirling mist is all that is visible. It
    moves in patterns that seem to defy the wind, as if time itself flows
    differently on the other side.

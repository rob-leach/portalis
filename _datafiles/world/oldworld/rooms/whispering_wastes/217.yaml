title: Frozen Wasteland
description: Standing at the entrance of a cave in the heart of the Whispering Wastes,
  the contrast between the relentless blizzard outside and the stillness within is
  stark. However, the cave mouth itself has been sealed off by an imposing construction
  barrier. Heavy iron plates form a wall across the entrance, anchored deep into the
  frozen stone. Warning lights flash in the eternal twilight, their orange glow
  reflecting off the icicles that frame the blocked passage like crystal teeth.
  The darkness beyond the barrier seems absolute, as if the caves have been
  swallowed by void.

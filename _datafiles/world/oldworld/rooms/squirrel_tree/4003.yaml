title: Mid-Trunk Chamber
description: The trunk widens here into a central chamber where multiple branches seem
  to converge. The walls are honeycombed with small tunnels leading in every direction,
  and the floor is carpeted with a thick layer of acorn shells and dried leaves. This
  appears to be a major hub of squirrel activity - territorial markings cover every
  surface, and the chittering has become a constant angry chorus. Paths lead up toward
  the canopy above, with passages branching off to what appear to be storage caches
  on either side.

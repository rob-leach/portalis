title: The Old Road
description: Brambles and thorns still encroach upon the path here, but the way east
  into what was once the Dark Forest is now completely blocked. A massive construction
  barricade stretches across the road, its iron frame wrapped in chains and secured
  with heavy padlocks. Brilliant orange warning lights strobe atop tall poles, and
  arcane hazard symbols have been painted across every available surface. The air
  beyond the barrier feels wrong somehow - too still, too empty, as if the forest
  itself has been erased from existence.

  barrier: The construction barrier is a formidable wall of iron plates and timber
    beams, clearly built to withstand significant force. Scorch marks and dents
    suggest previous attempts to breach it have been discouraged.
  barricade: :barrier
  chains: Heavy iron chains have been wrapped around the barrier frame and secured
    with padlocks the size of your fist. They look far too robust to pick.
  signs: The signs warn of REALITY RECONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS and DIMENSIONAL ENGINEERS
    ONLY. One ominously states UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY WILL RESULT IN EXISTENTIAL TERMINATION.
  lights: The warning lights are powered by small elemental fire sprites trapped
    in glass orbs atop the poles. They seem almost frantic in their pulsing.

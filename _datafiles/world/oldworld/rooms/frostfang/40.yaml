title: Frostfang Castle West Wing
description: The West Wing of Frostfang Castle stands in stark contrast to the rest
  of the fortress. Bathed in natural light, it boasts expansive windows that offer
  panoramic views of the surrounding landscapes. This wing is home to the castle's
  vast library, with towering shelves filled with ancient tomes, scrolls, and maps
  from distant lands. Adjacent chambers house collections of rare artifacts, from
  ornate armors to delicate pottery, each piece telling of trade, exploration, or
  conquest. The floors are covered in plush carpets, and the walls are adorned with
  vibrant tapestries depicting serene landscapes and maritime adventures.

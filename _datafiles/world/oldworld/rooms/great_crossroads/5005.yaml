title: Waypoint Stones
description: A circle of ancient standing stones marks a waypoint along the
  road. Travelers have camped here for generations - fire pits and bedrolls
  suggest this is a safe resting place. Carved into each stone are directions
  and distances to various destinations, though some carvings are too weathered
  to read. The Great Crossroads lies just ahead to the south, where multiple
  paths converge from across the realm.

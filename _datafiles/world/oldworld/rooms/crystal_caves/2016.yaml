title: Deep Hollow
description: The passage descends sharply here, opening into a hollow carved from
  dark obsidian-like crystal that absorbs rather than reflects light. The walls
  are smooth and cold to the touch, and the only illumination comes from veins
  of phosphorescent minerals that trace patterns like frozen lightning. The air
  is noticeably colder, and your breath mists before you. Something about this
  place feels old, primordial, as if you're descending into the very roots of
  the mountain. A passage continues south, the darkness ahead broken only by a
  distant, pulsing glow.

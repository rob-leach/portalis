title: Mushroom Garden
description: The crystalline walls give way here to a verdant underground garden of
  towering fungi. Bioluminescent mushrooms in shades of green, blue, and violet
  create a soft, dreamlike glow that illuminates the cavern. Some caps are broad
  enough to shelter beneath, while others are delicate spirals that seem to glow
  brighter when approached. The air is thick with spores that drift lazily on warm
  currents, and the earthy scent of growth mingles with a sweet, almost intoxicating
  fragrance. Small pools of condensation have collected in the hollows of larger
  mushroom caps.

- Something rustles in the fungal undergrowth, then goes still.
- The caps of nearby mushrooms pulse in sequence, like a silent conversation.

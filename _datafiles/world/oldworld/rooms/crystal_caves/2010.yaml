title: Fungal Cathedral
description: The cavern opens into a space of cathedral-like proportions, its ceiling
  lost in darkness far above. Enormous mushrooms grow here in concentric rings,
  their caps forming natural tiers like the galleries of an amphitheater. The
  central space is dominated by a single colossal fungus, its stem as wide as
  a tower and its cap spreading out like a dome, glowing with an intense golden
  light that bathes everything in warm amber. Smaller fungi cluster at its base
  like worshippers at an altar, and the air thrums with an almost palpable sense
  of ancient, patient life.

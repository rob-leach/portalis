title: Singing Crystals
description: This chamber is filled with crystal formations of extraordinary purity,
  each one tuned by nature to resonate at a specific frequency. The slightest
  movement of air causes them to sing, creating harmonies that shift and change
  as you move through the space. Some crystals are slender needles that produce
  high, clear notes, while others are massive resonating chambers that hum with
  deep bass tones. The effect is mesmerizing, a symphony of stone that seems to
  respond to your presence. The floor is strewn with smaller crystal shards that
  chime underfoot like wind chimes.

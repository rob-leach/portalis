KEY POINTS TO HIGHLIGHT IN COMMENT
===================================

1. Item durability is the skeleton key to sustainable crafting
   - Without it, economy stagnates
   - With it, creates ongoing demand

2. Portalis's container-based recipe system is solid foundation
   - Already discoverable (unlike failed MUDs)
   - Scriptable for complex mechanics

3. Power balance: crafted ≈ dropped ≈ quested
   - Avoid making crafted items superior
   - Maintain playstyle choice

4. Three common pitfalls to avoid:
   - Grind curse (visible progression, varied mechanics)
   - Hidden knowledge curse (discoverable recipes)
   - Economic stagnation (item decay + material scarcity)

5. Pre-launch testing critical
   - Test power level equivalence
   - Verify recipe discoverability
   - Monitor economy balance
